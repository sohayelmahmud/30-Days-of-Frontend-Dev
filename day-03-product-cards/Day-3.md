# 📦 30 Days of Web: Day 03 - Professional Service Cards

A collection of clean, responsive service cards featuring optimized layouts and interactive hover effects. This project focuses on Flexbox alignment, equal height containers, and advanced image handling.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Adaptive Grid Layout:** Powered by Flexbox with `flex-wrap` and `flex-grow` logic to ensure cards maintain consistent sizing and equal height across rows.
* **Smart Image Zoom:**
    * Profile/Service images utilize `object-fit: cover` to perfectly fill their containers.
    * Smooth 0.5s transition on hover creates a professional "magnified" effect without breaking the container bounds.
* **Integrated Action Footer:** A full-width footer strip implemented with negative margins, housing synchronized action buttons.
* **Polished Interactions:** * Cards lift on hover with a deep shadow for a 3D effect.
    * Buttons feature active states with `scale(0.95)` for tactile user feedback.

## 🎨 Design Systems
The project is pre-configured with three distinct color themes in the `:root`:
1. **Clean Light:** High-contrast professional look with a soft grey background.
2. **Dark Modern:** A deep navy aesthetic with vibrant blue accents for tech-focused designs.
3. **Soft Minimal:** A soothing teal and soft-white palette for a modern, friendly vibe.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Dynamic Theme Engine:** Add JavaScript to toggle between Light, Dark, and Soft themes instantly.
- [ ] **Icon Integration:** Replace static images with FontAwesome or SVG icons for better scalability.
- [ ] **Modal Integration:** Implement a "View Demo" pop-up using CSS or JS to showcase service details.
