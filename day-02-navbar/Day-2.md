# 📱 30 Days of Web: Day 02 - Responsive Navbar

A premium mobile tab bar built for a seamless app-like experience. This project focuses on mastering responsive navigation layouts and advanced CSS hover synchronization.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Adaptive Tab Layout:** Engineered with Flexbox and `space-around` logic to ensure perfect alignment across all screen sizes.
* **Synchronized Hover States:**
    * Icons lift up by 20px (`translateY`) smoothly, providing tactile feedback to the user.
    * Menu labels (spans) fade-in and float up from the bottom in perfect sync with the icon movement.
    * Text labels (spans) fade-in and float up from the bottom in perfect sync with the icon movement.
    * In Desktop view, the entire navbar lifts up to the top of the screen. Logo on the left & menu items on the right with hover effects.
* **Instant Border Integration:** A solid "cut-out" border appears instantly on hover without transition, creating a sharp and modern aesthetic.
* **Smart Visibility Logic:** Utilizes `opacity` and `visibility` tricks to ensure text labels transition gracefully instead of popping in abruptly.

## 🎨 Design Systems
The project is pre-configured with three distinct color themes in the `:root`:
1. **Light Professional:** A clean white background with a classic blue accent.
2. **Deep Navy Dark:** A sleek dark-blue aesthetic for a modern "tech" look.
3. **Soft Minimal:** A soothing palette featuring teal and soft-white tones.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Indicator Animation:** Implement JavaScript to create a sliding indicator that follows the active menu item.
- [ ] **Glassmorphism Look:** Use backdrop-filters to give the navbar a translucent, blurred background.
- [ ] **Active Page Persistence:** Add logic to keep the current page's icon in the active/hovered state by default.
