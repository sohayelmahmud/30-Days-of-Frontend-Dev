# 🪪 30 Days of Web: Day 01 - Profile Card

A modern, interactive profile card built as part of my 30-day web development challenge. This project focuses on mastering CSS layouts, hover interactions, and color variables.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Signature Typography:** Used a fancy cursive font for the name to give it a personal touch.
* **Smart Hover Effects:**
    * Card lifts up and gains a deeper shadow on hover.
    * Profile image scales to 1.1x within its circular container.
    * Buttons change background color smoothly on hover.
* **Integrated Footer:** A full-width colored footer strip created using negative margin techniques.
* **Modern Spacing:** Perfectly balanced gaps using Flexbox and margin resets.

## 🎨 Design Systems
The project is pre-configured with three distinct color themes in the `:root`:
1. **Clean Light:** High-contrast professional look.
2. **Dark Modern:** Sleek dark-blue aesthetic.
3. **Soft Minimal:** A soothing teal and soft-white palette.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Dynamic Theme Switcher:** Implement JavaScript to toggle between the 3 themes via a button.
- [ ] **Interactive Buttons:** Add "Active" states and click sounds/effects for the Follow/Message buttons.
- [ ] **Team Layout:** Expand this into a responsive grid featuring multiple cards (Day 02 Challenge).
