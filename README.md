# 30 Days of Frontend Davelopment

I challenge myself to learn and build a new frontend project every day for 30 days. This repository contains all the projects I create during this challenge.

## Projects
- Each project is organized in its own folder named `day-01-project_name`, `day-02-project_name`, ..., `day-30-project_name`. Inside each folder, you will find the source code and a README file explaining the project.

- Firstly , I will focus on only HTML and CSS for the first 15 days, and then I will incorporate JavaScript for the remaining days. Later on, I  will modify some of the earlier projects to include JavaScript functionality as well.

## Project List
1. Day 01: [Profile Card](day-01-profile-card) [Include Photo, name, bio, buttons]
2. Day 02: [Navbar](day-02-navbar) [Logo, home, about, contact links]
